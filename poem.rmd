## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
“What may I do?” at length I cried,


Tired of the painful task.

The fairy quietly replied,


And said, “You must not ask.”
 
“Rules and Regulations,” in addition to commenting upon correctness in writing, also contains remonstrations. 
It refers to the problem of stammering, which plagued Dodgson throughout his life, emphasizing his shyness and becoming a major factor when he considered acceptance of any public-speaking engagements   


## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,    

And sorry I could not travel both  

And be one traveler, long I stood  

And looked down one as far as I could  

To where it bent in the undergrowth; 
 

Then took the other, as just as fair,  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      
Shining with all his might:  

He did his very best to make  
      
The billows smooth and bright —  

And this was odd, because it was  
      
The middle of the night.  


The moon was shining sulkily,  
    
  Because she thought the sun  

Had got no business to be there  
    
  After the day was done —    

"It's very rude of him," she said,    
   
   "To come and spoil the fun."       


## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
 
tell the flowers—they think  
the sun loves them.  
The grass is under the same  
simple-minded impression   

about the rain, the fog, the dew.  
And when the wind blows,   
it feels so good   
they lose control of themselves   

and swobtoggle wildly   
around, bumping accidentally into their   
slender neighbors.   
Forgetful little lotus-eaters,   
 
solar-powered   
hydroholics, drawing nourishment up   
through stems into their   
thin green skin,    

high on the expensive   
chemistry of mitochondrial explosion,   
believing that the dirt   
loves them, the night, the stars—    
  
reaching down a little deeper    
with their pale albino roots,   
all Dizzy    
Gillespie with the utter   
sufficiency of everything.   

They don't imagine lawn   
mowers, the four stomachs   
of the cow, or human beings with boots   
who stop to marvel   

at their exsquisite   
flexibility and color.   
They persist in their soft-headed   

hallucination of happiness.   
But please don't mention it.   
Not yet. Tell me   
what would you possibly gain   

from being right?
