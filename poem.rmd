## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
“What may I do?” at length I cried,

Tired of the painful task.

The fairy quietly replied,

And said, “You must not ask.”


“Rules and Regulations,” in addition to commenting upon correctness in writing, also contains remonstrations. It refers to the problem of stammering, which plagued Dodgson throughout his life, emphasizing his shyness and becoming a major factor when he considered acceptance of any public-speaking engagements:

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

Then took the other, as just as fair,   

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —    
"It's very rude of him," she said,    
      "To come and spoil the fun."    

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
